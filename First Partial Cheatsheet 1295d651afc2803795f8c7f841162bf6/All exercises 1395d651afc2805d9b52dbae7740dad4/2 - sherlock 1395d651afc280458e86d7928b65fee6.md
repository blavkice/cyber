# 2 - sherlock

**exp: there are some letters in caps lock, let’s extract them first, we got a pseudo binary text we need it to convert to real binary and then to ascii**

Sherlock has a mystery in front of him. Help him to find the flag.

```python
# given a file -> prints all uppercase ASCII letters

                    if c.isupper(): res += c
    return res

# flag is sort of binary, i need to replace
text = text.replace("ZERO", "0")

    # convert binary to ASCII
    ascii_characters = [chr(int(bv, 2)) for bv in binary_values]
    # join the characters into a single string
    ascii_string = ''.join(ascii_characters)

print(binary_to_ascii(text))
