Crack the cipher: vhixoieemksktorywzvhxzijqni

Your clue is:

"caesar is everything. But he took it to the next level."

**exp: next level to caesar is vignerè**

### 1. **Vigenère Cipher Table**

The Vigenère cipher uses a table (also called a tabula recta) where each row is a shifted alphabet. Here’s a small example of how the table looks:

| Key Letter | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **A** | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z |
| **B** | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z | A |
| **C** | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z | A | B |
| **D** | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z | A | B | C |
| **E** | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z | A | B | C | D |
| **...** | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| **Z** | Z | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y |

### 2. **Example Encryption**

**Plaintext**: `HELLO`

**Key**: `KEYKE` (repeated to match the length of the plaintext)

To encrypt:

1. **Find each pair of Plaintext and Key letters in the table**:
    - `H` (Plaintext) and `K` (Key) -> Go to the row for `K`, find column `H`: Result is `R`
    - `E` and `E` -> Row `E`, Column `E`: Result is `I`
    - `L` and `Y` -> Row `Y`, Column `L`: Result is `J`
    - `L` and `K` -> Row `K`, Column `L`: Result is `V`
    - `O` and `E` -> Row `E`, Column `O`: Result is `S`
2. **Ciphertext**: `RIJVS`
