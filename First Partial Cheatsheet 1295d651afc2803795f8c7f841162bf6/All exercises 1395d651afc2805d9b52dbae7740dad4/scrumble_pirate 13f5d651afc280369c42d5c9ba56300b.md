at his death, the words he spoke drove countless men out to sea.
gold roger: my treasure? it's yours if you want it. find it! i left all the world has there!
narrator: and so men set sights on the grand line, in pursuit of their dreams and find the great treasure left
behind, the one piece.

shanks, monkey d. luffy heads out to the sea on a journey on the road to become king of the pirates!
