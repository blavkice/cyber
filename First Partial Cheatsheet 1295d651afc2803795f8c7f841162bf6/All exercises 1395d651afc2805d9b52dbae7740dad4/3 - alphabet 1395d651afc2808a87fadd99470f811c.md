# 3 - alphabet

**exp: we have to do cryptoanalysis because caesar o vignere doesn’t bring us anywere…**

1. we count char occurrences to help us during the process of identifying chars
2. we look at the text and see some details and try by hand replacing everytime
3. to replace a char everytime
    
    ```python
    # to replace K with i (downcase the replacer!!!)
    voc['K'] = 'i'y
    replaced = ''.join(c if c not in voc else voc[c] for c in enc)
    print(voc, '\n', replaced)
    ```
    

```python
enc = "MKXU IDKMI DM BDASKMI NLU XCPJNDICFQ! K VDMGUC KW PDT GKG NLKB HP LFMG DC TBUG PDTC CUBDTCXUB. K'Q BTCU MDV PDT VFMN F WAFI BD LUCU KN KB WAFI GDKMINLKBHPLFMGKBQDCUWTMNLFMFMDMAKMUNDDA"
# caesar won't bring us anywhere...
# i have to do some cryptoanalysis: find the possible
# assocations between every letter and the alphabet
char_freq = {}
for c in enc:
    if c not in char_freq:
        char_freq[c] = 1
    else: char_freq[c] += 1
# sort the dictionary with frequencies ad print
sorted_freq = sorted(char_freq.items(), key=lambda kv: kv[1], reverse = True)
print(sorted_freq)

# i now assume that text is english written
# online we find most used chars
# http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~mec/2003-2004/cryptography/subs/frequencies.html
# E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ...

# i can create a partial vocabulary and see...
voc = {}

# i can see there is a "K" alone...it can be an i
voc['K'] = 'i'
# i can copy all text replacing only letters in the partial dictionary
replaced = ''.join(c if c not in voc else voc[c] for c in enc)
print(voc, '\n' ,replaced)

# i can see there is a "I'Q"... Q is probably an M
voc['Q'] = 'm'
replaced = ''.join(c if c not in voc else voc[c] for c in enc)
print(voc, '\n' ,replaced)

# i can see there is "F" alone.. it's probably an a
voc['F'] = 'a'
replaced = ''.join(c if c not in voc else voc[c] for c in enc)
print(voc, '\n' ,replaced)

# WAaI is maybe "flag"

replaced = ''.join(c if c not in voc else voc[c] for c in enc)
print(voc, '\n' ,replaced)

# VondUC maybe is wonder?
voc['V'] = 'w'
voc['U'] = 'e'
voc['C'] = 'r'
replaced = ''.join(c if c not in voc else voc[c] for c in enc)
print(voc, '\n' ,replaced)

# if PoT did... PoT -> you?
voc['P'] = 'y'
voc['T'] = 'u'
replaced = ''.join(c if c not in voc else voc[c] for c in enc)
print(voc, '\n' ,replaced)

# uBed -> used
voc['B'] = 's'
replaced = ''.join(c if c not in voc else voc[c] for c in enc)
print(voc, '\n' ,replaced)

# NLis -> this
voc['N'] = 't'

print(voc, '\n' ,replaced)

# solSing

print(voc, '\n' ,replaced)

# niXe -> nice
voc['X'] = 'c'
replaced = ''.join(c if c not in voc else voc[c] for c in enc)
print(voc, '\n' ,replaced)

# this Hy hand
voc['H'] = 'b'
replaced = ''.join(c if c not in voc else voc[c] for c in enc)
print(voc, '\n' ,replaced)

# cryJtogram
voc['J'] = 'p'
replaced = ''.join(c if c not in voc else voc[c] for c in enc)
print(voc, '\n' ,replaced)

print("finished?", replaced.islower())
```

→ nice going on solving the cryptogram! i wonder if you did this by hand or used your resources. 
i'm sure now you want a flag so here it is flag ***doingthisbyhandismorefunthananonlinetool***
