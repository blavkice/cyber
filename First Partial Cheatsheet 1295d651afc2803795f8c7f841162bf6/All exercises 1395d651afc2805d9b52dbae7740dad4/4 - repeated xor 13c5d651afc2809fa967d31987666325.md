# 4 - repeated xor

There's a secret passcode hidden in the robot's "history of cryptography" module.
But it's encrypted! Here it is, hex-encoded: encrypted.txt. Can you find the hidden passcode?

Hint:
Like the title suggests, this is repeating-key XOR. You should try to find the length of the key

- it's probably around 10 bytes long, maybe a little less or a little more.

#Follow the following procedure
STEP 1: Key length identification
#1.1 set the key length to test
#1.2 shift the secret string by key_length
#1.3 count the number of characters that are the same in the same position
between the original secret and its shifterd version
#1.4 take the highest frequency over different key length by repearing 1.1 - 1.3

#STEP 2. Cryptoanalysis

```python
with open('encrypted.txt', 'r') as file:
    secret = file.read()

def hex2dec(text):
    res = []
    for i in range(len(text)//2):
        # get the current pair of hex
        curr = text[i*2:(i+1)*2]
        # convert to int
        res.append(int(curr, 16))
    return res

secret = hex2dec(secret)
# now we have to identify key length:
# it is very probable to be the iteration where max repetitions
# of the same letters occur by comparing original text and shitfted text
# by i where i = 0 to len(text)
def shift(text, i):
    # from i to the end + until i
    return text[i:] + text[:i]
# counter of charatchers in the same position given 2 strings
def same_position_char(s1, s2):
    frequency = 0
    for x,y in zip(s1, s2): 
        if(x == y): frequency += 1
    return frequency
# now we print frequencies near i = 8 (hint)
for i in range(5, 15):
    fr = same_position_char(secret, shift(secret,i))
    print(f"for shift nr.\t{i}\tfrequency is:\t{fr}")
# ferquency is the most on 8! ~250
# let's now assume key length is 8
# let's split ciphertext in blocks of 8
def splitter(text, len):
    res = []
    for i in range(len):
        res.append(text[i::len])
    return res

secret_blocks = splitter(secret, 8)

# now we need to retreive the k-th most frequent char in a string
from collections import Counter
def k_char(text, k):
    freq = Counter(text)
    # and i can order
    ordered = sorted(freq.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return ordered[k][0]

# we have to do cryptoanalysis... let's assume that the most frequent
# char is the space ' '
poss_key = [k_char(secret_blocks[i], 0) for i in range(8)]
# poss_key is made of the most frequent char for every "column" index
# a reverted xor is sufficient if the assumption of ' ' correct!
key = [c ^ ord(' ') for c in poss_key]
def ordinals_to_string(ordinals_list):
		return ''.join(chr(ordinal) for ordinal in ordinals_list)
print(ordinals_to_string(key)) # don't know but...
# let's try to decode
msg = ''
for i in range(len(secret)):
    msg += chr(secret[i] ^ key[i % 8])
print(msg)
```
