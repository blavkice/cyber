**exp: just extract words from locations**

The hard drive may be corrupted, but you were able to recover a small chunk of text (see "book.txt").
Scribbled on the back of the hard drive is a set of mysterious numbers. Can you discover the meaning behind these numbers? (1, 9, 4) (4, 2, 8) (4, 8, 3) (7, 1, 5) (8, 10, 1)
