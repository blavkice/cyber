# replace 2 recurring chars into binary and then convert into str

```python
with open("filename", "r") as file:
    secret = file.read()
    secret = secret.replace("Z", "0")
    secret = secret.replace("O", "1")
    print(secret)
    
    def binary_to_ascii(binary_string):
        # Split the binary string by spaces
        binary_values = binary_string.split(" ")
        # Convert each binary segment to an ASCII character
        ascii_characters = [chr(int(bv, 2)) for bv in binary_values if bv]
        # Join the characters into a single string
        ascii_string = ''.join(ascii_characters)
        return ascii_string
```

## extract_words

i want to extracts words in a block divided text knowing some locations

```python
# given a file that has blocks, lines, words
# and an matrix containing locations [[b, l, w], [b, l, w]]
# -> prints words at specified locations
def extract_words(filename, locations):
    with open(filename, "r") as book:
        # read content and split into blocks
        blocks = book.read().split("\n\n")
        # blocks is now an array
        flag = ''
        # iterate through locations
        for loc in locations:
            block_num, line_num, word_num = loc
            # let's make sure block exists
            if(block_num <= len(blocks)):
                block = blocks[block_num-1]
                lines = block.split("\n")
                # now i have the lines of the i-block
                # let's make sure line exists
                if line_num <= len(lines):
                    line = lines[line_num-1]
                    words = line.split()
                    # same for words
                    if word_num <= len(words):
                        word = words[word_num-1]
                        # i have now selected the word!
                        flag += word + ' '
        # now i can concatenate and print the flag
        print(flag.strip())
```

## extract uppercase \ lowercase chars

```python
# given a file -> prints all uppercase ASCII letters
# concatenated togheter without spaces
def upper_letter_extractor(filename):
    with open(filename, "r") as file:
        res = ''
        for line in file.readlines():
            words = line.split()
            for word in words:
                for c in word:
                    if c.isupper(): res += c
    return res
```

## ~~replace 2 recurring chars in a file of a single line~~

```python
# given a file with a single line where there are
# 2 recurring chars -> string with them replaced
def line_reader_replacer(filename):
    with open(filename, "r") as file:
        line = file.readline()
        words = ''.join(line.split())
        words = words.replace("ZERO", "0")
        words = words.replace("ONE", "1")
        return words
```

```python
    def line_reader_replacer(line):
        words = ''.join(line.split())
        words = words.replace("ZERO", "0")
        words = words.replace("ONE", "1")
        return words
```

## xor 2 strings → ord list

```python
def xor_strings(s1, s2):
    # convert strings to their ordinal representations
    or1 = string_to_ordinals(s1)
    or2 = string_to_ordinals(s2)
    # adjust strings length to make sure they are equal
    # by adding padding if needed
    max_len = max(len(or1), len(or2))
    or1 += [0] * (max_len - len(or1))
    or2 += [0] * (max_len - len(or2))
    # xor and return the result
    return [a ^ b for a,b in zip(or1, or2)]
```

requires `string_to_ordinals`

```python
def string_to_ordinals(input_string):
	return [ord(char) for char in input_string]

def ordinals_to_string(ordinals_list):
		return ''.join(chr(ordinal) for ordinal in ordinals_list)
```

## string shift

```python
def shift(text, i):
    # from i to the end + until i
    return text[i:] + text[:i]
```

## same position char counter between 2 strings

```python
def same_position_char(s1, s2):
    frequency = 0
    for x,y in zip(s1, s2): 
        if(x == y): frequency += 1
    return frequency
```

## COLUMNS splitter → list of subtype

```python
def splitter(text, len):
    res = []
    for i in range(len):
        res.append(text[i::len])
    return res
```

`text[i::length]` slices the `text` string, starting at index `i` and taking every `length`th character after that

```python
ciphertext = [0x1c, 0x3a, 0x17, 0x21, 0x2f, 0x1e, 0x2f, 0x0e]
# this represents [28, 58, 23, 33, 47, 30, 47, 14] in decimal
```

### suppose len = 3

- Block 1: `ciphertext[0::3]` → `[28, 33, 47]`
- Block 2: `ciphertext[1::3]` → `[58, 47, 14]`
- Block 3: `ciphertext[2::3]` → `[23, 30]`

## k-th most frequent char in a string

```python
from collections import Counter
def k_char(text, k):
    freq = Counter(text)
    # and i can order
    ordered = sorted(freq.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return ordered[k][0]
```
